<p>Sunshine, a leading <a href="http://www.gomobilemichigan.org/resources/industry-trade-associations.html" target="_blank">cellphone repair tools</a>supplier, keep putting forward solutions for mobile phone repairs. It meets the demands for different cellphone problems with more professional tools. </p>
<p>For new learners in mobile phone repairing industry, a useful tool would help them a lot. John just finished his courses in a training school and starts his own business in a small <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13614919/" target="_blank">cell phone repair shop.</a>While recently he got some troubles. “I’m not as professional as those experienced mechanics now, I can’t get a suitable temperature when operating, cause my <a href="https://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/t78nvc/global_mobile" target="_blank">solder iron</a>could not show me what the temperature exactly is at the moment.” Well, it seems really inconvenient. Users could not know the temperature is going up or down. But we have SS-928D to solve this problem. It has a display to show you the <a href="http://www.wholesalecentral.com/Telephone-Cellular.html" target="_blank">temperature</a>. Different from other portable solder irons, this product is temperature adjustable. In addition, there’s a lock to fix one temperature when it’s needed and fault operation could be avoided. </p>

<p>“I know what temperature is suitable for repairing certain problems of phones now. The degree it shows is precise. This solder iron heat up quickly. It takes only a few seconds to reach over three hundred degree.” John later tell us. Actually, the <a href="http://www.mobilecellphonerepairing.com/" target="_blank">ceramic heating element</a>help it better conducts heat. That’s what makes it different from others.</p>
