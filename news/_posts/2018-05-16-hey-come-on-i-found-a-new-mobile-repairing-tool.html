<p>SS-034 stencil which is specially designed with rounded square holes would be easier to uncover the mother board after planting tin on IC.</p>
<p>When talking about<a href="cellphone repairing,（http://www.gomobilemichigan.org/resources/industry-trade-associations.html" target="_blank">cellphone repairing</a>,some may think of we Sunshine, which keep developing new items for repairing. Let’s see what it bring us this time.</p>

<p>For repairing mother board, one of the tools mechanics must need is the<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13614919/" target="_blank">BGA stencil</a>.“A bad stencil makes things even worse. After planting tin and heating it by hot air gun, a bad stencil may be hard to take off. If remove by force the mother board would suffer a second time damage.” Jimmy was talking to his students. He owned a<a href="https://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/t78nvc/global_mobile" target="_blank">repairing shop</a>before, but now teaching in a training school. This day he brought his students to purchase some tools in our shop. “I’ve try this stencil. It’s soft. Thinner than the one I’m using. And the<a href="http://www.mobilecellphonerepairing.com/" target="_blank">rounded square hole</a>design is good. The stencil is not out of shape or destroy the IC just being repaired.” That’s what many customers told us after using, what’s more, its<a href="http://www.wholesalecentral.com/Telephone-Cellular.html" target="_blank">high precision of holes</a>is also a highlight.</p>
