<p>In the<a href="http://www.wholesalecentral.com/Telephone-Cellular.html" target="_blank">mobile phone repair tool industry</a>,we have a wide range of ICs that are constantly growing in size. As the precision of mobile phones becomes higher and higher, the demand for mobile phone repair tools is also increasing. As a<a href="https://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/t78nvc/global_mobile" target="_blank">SUNSHINE mobile phone repair tool</a>for the development of the maintenance tool industry, we have been working hard to provide better tools for maintenance engineers. One of them is our<a href="https://www.ifixit.com/" target="_blank">SUNSHINE 101A IC PRY KNIFE</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to this, we had produced similar tools and other brands of the same type of products according to the needs of the maintenance technicians. Then one day, my customer asked me, I would like to choose which kind of tool is better? Because the blade shape of the tool is not the same, we must meet the different needs of the<a href="https://repair.org/" target="_blank">maintenance master</a>so we can only tell the customer that both of your customers can use it and which one is needed. But now with the SUNSHINE 101A IC PRY KNIFE, it is<a href="http://www.mobilecellphonerepairing.com/" target="_blank">equipped</a>with 27 different blades that can meet all the requirements of the maintenance master, demolition, pick, hook, shovel and so on. With it, you have the world, hahaha.</p>
