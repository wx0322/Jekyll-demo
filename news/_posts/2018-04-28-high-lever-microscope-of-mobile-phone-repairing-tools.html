<p>A <a href="https://www.facebook.com/VIPSUNSHINETOOLS/" target="_blank">microscope</a>is an optical instrument consisting of a lens or a combination of several lenses. It is a sign of human beings entering the atomic age. It is mainly used to enlarge tiny objects and become a device that human eyes can see.</p>
<p>Microscopes can be classified into microscopic principles for polarizing microscopy, optical microscopy, electron microscopy, and digital microscopy.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/VIPSUNSHINETOOLS/" target="_blank">cell phone repair</a> industry generally uses electron microscopes and optical microscopes.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at Sunshine's <a href="https:/www.linkedin.com/company/13614919/" target="_blank">optical microscope</a></p>
<p>SZM1490-B8SL Zoom Stereo Microscope</p>
<p>1. Superior optical component with special cladding layer, to provide high quality optical image. It satisfies phone's <a href="http://www.wholesalecentral.com/Telephone-Cellular.html" target="_blank">motherboard repairing</a>and could be used in modern biology, medicine, scientific research and modern electronic industry online testing. This microscope also satisfy other science technology industry which requires high precision.</p>
<p>2. <a href="http://www.gomobilemichigan.org/resources/industry-trade-associations.html" target="_blank">14-90X zoom</a>,angling eye lens to 45 degrees. Binocular visibility could be adjusted to ensure clear enough image for different eyesights.</p>

<p>1. Imitation of moisture If the interior is wet, the optical lenses are prone to mildew and fog.</p>
<p>2. Imitation corrosion microscope can not be placed together with corrosive chemicals</p>
<p>3. The purpose of imitating heat is mainly to avoid opening and detachment of the lens due to thermal expansion and contraction.</p>
<p>4. Do not touch sharp objects</p>
